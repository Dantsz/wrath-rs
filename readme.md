# Wrath-rs: World of Warcraft: Wotlk server emulator in pure rust.
This is an educational project to create  a server emulator for World of Warcraft patch 3.3.5 (12340) in Rust. It uses `async-std` to remain fully asynchronous for maximum performance. It is nowhere near playable, let alone feature complete right now. Contributions in the form of pull requests are welcome, though there is currently no well-organised backlog of issues or workflow. 

## WARNING: REFACTOR BRANCH
This branch is WIP refactor work, the server on this branch is in a very broken state and will likely not even compile.
For a working version, check out the _main_ branch.

## Current Feature Status
Everything is broken

## Getting Started
Getting familiar with the project is _highly_ discouraged on this branch. Check out the main branch
